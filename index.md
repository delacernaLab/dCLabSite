# Curiosity leads to cures.

We are a highly curious group who are optimistic that one day this curiosity will lead to advancements that will increase our understanding of life and, in the process, improve it. Our group is based on the Armstrong Campus of Georgia Southern University in Savannah, GA. The dela Cerna group is broadly interested in anything involving proteins. Currently, majority of our efforts are directed towards proteins involved in cancers, particularly protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP).
