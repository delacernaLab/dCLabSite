# {% include icon.html icon="fa-regular fa-envelope" %}Contact

We are always eager to talk to anyone who might be interested in what we are doing in the laboratory and beyond. If you would like to explore possible collaborations or just want to know more, do not hesitate to get in touch. You might also just want to drop by if you are in town - Savannah is beautiful (although Mark is not particularly fond of the heat and humidity...). We are located at the Science Center in Georgia Southern's Armstrong Campus. Our research labs are at SC2309 and SC2307 and Mark's office is SC2012.
