# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Our group welcomes anyone interested in protein biochemistry and drug discovery, particularly members of historically marginalized and underrepresented communities. We value diversity and inclusivity and strive to promote and practice inclusive science. As Georgia Southern is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI), undergraduate researchers are a crucial part of our team. The dC lab commits to training and mentoring undergraduate students from any major to provide them with laboratory and research skills that can be applied to their future goals. While majority of our current members are Biochemistry/Chemistry majors, the dC Research Group actively participates in the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) Program as the PB&J Group (Protein Biochemistry and Just About Anything: Intersection of Chemistry and Medicine) where we encourage interdisciplinary collaborations and projects involving students from any department.

The dC Research Group is affiliated with the Institute of Coastal Plain Science and can host graduate students (MS or PhD) in Environmental Science. Our department (BCP) also offers an MS in Applied Physical Science graduate program. Interested students may also choose to matriculate in the MS Biology program. GS is currently evolving and growing and other graduate programs will be available in the future. Unfortunately, we currently are not able to support post-doctoral and staff scientists. We are continuously seeking extramural funding to change this! Do not hesitate to contact Mark to explore any opportuntity, including collaborations.
